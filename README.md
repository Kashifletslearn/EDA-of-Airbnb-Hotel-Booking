# EDA-of-Airbnb-Hotel-Booking

Exploratory Data Analysis Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions. EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them.

Project Summary - This project aims to create meaningful estimators from the data set we have, and to perform Exploratory Data Analysis. Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests This data set contains a single file that compares various booking information between two hotels: a city hotel and a resort hotel. and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. WE will be using the data to analyze the factors affecting the Hotel Bookings.
